________

Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB) is a free, powerful Material Design UI KIT for Bootstrap 4. It is one of the most comprehensive material design frameworks that was created to date.  

Every day we challenged ourselves to create a visual language for us and our users that combines the classic principles of genuine design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. That's what Material Design is about. Today we combine it with Bootstrap - most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first websites and apps. Bootstrap makes web development way faster and easier regardless of skill levels, devices and projects.    

Our framework includes CSS for handling Animations, Colors, Typography, Helpers, Hover effects, Shadows, Icons, Components, and JavaScript. Additionally, it offers Badges, Buttons, Social buttons, Cards, Footer, Forms, Material box, Nabbers, Pagination, Panels, Parallax, Progress bar, Tables, Galleries and JavaScript.
