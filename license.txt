** MDB cannot be used to create a product which is redistributed in an automated way. I.e. our license doesn't allow to create 
another framework which will be available on your website and your customers can pay and download the framework from your website 
including MDB libraries. On the other hand, if you create a custom app which requires manual installation on customer site, it is 
allowed to use MDB for that purpose.
